- redux for auth???
- Do it again, but pretty, with a schema
- regex FE validator BE
- (authcheck should just be a protected getUser route)

Auth Flow:
- createUser/login.
- try to access a resource run auth/refresh, if that fails ask for login.
- logout

- setup crud app on Render / netlify
- then implement auth
